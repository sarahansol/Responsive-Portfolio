<h1>About Me</h1>

      <img class="auth-image" src="assets/images/pic.jpg" style="width:200px;height:200px;" alt="SarahHan">


      <p>My name is Sarah Han, and I am a MBA candidate currently recruiting for a pre-MBA internship in San Francisco Bay Area. Welcome to my beta website that I created after two weeks of coding class! I had absolutely no knowledge of coding before two weeks ago and this website will improve as I become more skillful at coding so please bear with me :)</p>
      <p>
      For the past five years, I worked as a senior associate project manager at SAP for multiple projects that drive digital transformation for global Fortune 500 clients.  Traveling across North America to meet clients from different industries and seeing how technology transforms the most conservative industries to become digitalized fascinated me. </p>
      <P>I decided to get further involved in the world of technology and get my hands dirty by learning programming myself.  By learning programming, I believe that I would be able to communicate much more efficiently with engineers and understand the clients' needs more effectively. </P>
      <p>This is why I moved to San Francisco to learn coding at UC Berkeley, while networking with potential MBA recruiters in the area</p>
      <p>With my extensive business knowledge and experiences in tech, combined with programming skills learned from UC Berkeley, I believe I would be a great fit for MBA intern at leading technology firms in the Bay Area.  I look forward to connecting with you and build the relationship that will last throughout the course of my MBA and post-graduation</p>
      <p>I am a global business professional and an avid traveler.  I lived and worked in four countries (U.S., Canada, Korea, Qatar.) and traveled over 30 countries across 5 continents. Traveling and working with teams and clients from all over the world are my passion.</p>
